Here is a simplistic algorithm for adding code to our repository.

    * Put the task you are working on to "In progress" status
    * Create a branch from the main branch name it something like team/{team}/team/{branch_name} (back/server_fixes for example)
    * Do your code magic
    * Don't forget the tests
        if there were many changes in the main branch while you were working - rebase on dev branch
    * Create a Pull Request(PR)
    * Post about it in Teams "Review" channel
    * Wait for the code review
    * Commit changes if needed
    * Wait for approval
    * Close and merge PR (use "Squash" merge policy please)
    * Move the task to "Done" status
    *  Get another one ðŸ˜ƒ
